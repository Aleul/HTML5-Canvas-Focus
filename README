  all canvas tags, to see if it's inside of one
  If it is 'FOCUS.id' is set to the index of the
  canvas that was clicked.  'FOCUS.list' contains
  all the canvas tags.  So if you only in the keyDown
  event before anything else just check if 'FOCUS.focused'
  is true, and if it is 'event.preventDefault()'.
